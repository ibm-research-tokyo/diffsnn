Differentiable Spiking Neural Networks
--------------------------------------

This repository contains Python implementation of a spiking neural network based on point processes.
In particular, a differentiable point process is implemented, which enables us to train a spking neural network with hidden units efficiently.

# How to install
Run
```bash
pip install .
```

# Experiments
See `tasks/synthetic` for experiments using a synthetic data set.
